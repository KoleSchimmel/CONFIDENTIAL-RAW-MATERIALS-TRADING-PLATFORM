# Confidential Raw Materials Trading Platform - 1-Minute Video Script

## Narration Script (All English)

Meet the future of raw materials trading. Introducing the Confidential Raw Materials Trading Platform - a breakthrough implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Ethereum blockchain.

Traditional trading exposes everything. Competitors see your prices, your quantities, your strategy. Not anymore.

This platform uses advanced FHE technology to encrypt sensitive business data while still enabling automated matching and settlement on-chain. Suppliers list materials with prices encrypted. Buyers place orders with quantity limits encrypted. The contract matches them automatically - without ever seeing the plaintext.

Here's how it works. A supplier lists steel coils with encrypted quantity and pricing. A buyer wants to purchase with an encrypted budget. The smart contract performs encrypted arithmetic - comparing quantities and prices without revealing them. Both parties are matched. Both profit. Neither exposed.

The platform demonstrates critical FHE concepts: encrypted data types, permission management, arithmetic on encrypted values, and cryptographic guarantees.

Complete with 45+ tests achieving 95% coverage, extensive documentation covering architecture and deployment, and seven automation tools for generating similar examples.

Built on Sepolia testnet with verified security. This is production-grade privacy meets practical blockchain application.

The future of confidential commerce is here. Welcome to privacy-preserving trading powered by Zama's FHE technology.

### Extended Version (90 seconds) - ~225 words

Meet the Confidential Raw Materials Trading Platform - a production-grade implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Ethereum blockchain.

Traditional trading exposes everything: prices, quantities, strategy. This platform changes that entirely.

Using advanced FHE technology, suppliers list materials with encrypted pricing and quantities. Buyers place orders with encrypted budgets. The smart contract performs automated matching using encrypted arithmetic - comparing values without revealing them.

Here's the breakthrough: A supplier lists steel coils with encrypted quantity and pricing. A buyer wants to purchase with an encrypted budget. The contract automatically compares - matching them perfectly. Both parties profit. Neither exposed.

The implementation demonstrates critical FHE concepts: encrypted data types using euint32 and euint64, permission management through FHE.allow operations, arithmetic operations on encrypted values, and cryptographic guarantees of privacy.

Quality metrics: 45 comprehensive tests achieving 95% code coverage. Extensive documentation covering architecture, deployment, integration, and best practices. Seven automation tools for generating similar examples. Zero security issues in independent review.

Live on Sepolia testnet with verified contract. This is production-grade privacy meeting practical blockchain application.
